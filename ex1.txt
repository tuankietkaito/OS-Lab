EXERCISE 1

1. Compiling a program in the first time usually takes a longer time in comparison with the next 
   re-compiling. What is the reason?     

2. Is there any Makefile mechanism for other programming languages? If it has, give an example?
   JAVA Makefile: using java compiler (javac)
   Example: a simple makefile for compiling 3 java classes
         # Makefile
         # -g flag: generate all debugging info
         # typing 'make' will invoke the first target entry in the makefile ("all" in this case)
         all: Average.class Square.class Power.class
         
         Average.class: Average.java
            javac -g Average.java

         Square.class: Square.java
            javac -g Square.java

         Power.class: Power.java
            javac -g Power.java

         clean:
            rm *.class

3. In case of source code files located in different places, how can we write a Makefile?
