Bonus: Any other way to save and quit? what is the different between?
    There are 2 other ways to save and quit in vim:
    1. First type :w and press Enter to save and then type :q and press Enter to quit.
       This way is actually not different from typing :wq and press Enter.
    2. Type :x and press Enter
       The difference between these two commands is that :x writes the buffer to the file only if 
       there are unsaved changes, whereas :wq always writes the buffer to file and updates the file 
       modification time.

Bonus: What is Interpreter? what is the different between compiler and interpreter?
        An interpreter is a computer program that is used to directly execute program instructions 
    written using high-level programming languages. The interpreter transforms the high-level program 
    into an intermediate language that it then executes, or it could parse the high-level source code 
    and then performs the commands directly, which is done line by line.
        Interpreters and compilers are very similar in structure. The main difference is that an 
    interpreter directly executes the instructions in the source programming language while a compiler 
    translates those instructions into efficient machine code. The other different is that in compiler, 
    program execution is separated from the compilation and it performed only after the entire output 
    program is compiled whereas in interpreter, program execution is a part of interpretation process, 
    so it is performed line by line intermidiately.
